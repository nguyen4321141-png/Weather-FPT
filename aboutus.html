            <p>WeatherActive is user-friendly platform designed to help you plan your outdoor activities with confidence. 
                By combining real-time forecasts from OpenWeather and historical climatology data from NASA POWER, it not only tells you what the weather will be, 
                but also suggests group-friendly outdoor activities tailored to the conditions. Whether it’s a sunny picnic, a hiking trip, or just a simple walk, 
                our site makes planning simple, reliable, and fun.

        <div class="Purpose">
            <h1 style="color: rgba(73, 91, 106, 0.518);">How necessary is WeatherActive?</h1>
            <p>Whenever planning an activity for the future, having accurate information is key to ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience. 
                Often, you don’t realize how useful a tool like WeatherActive can be until it’s too late, when a night out with friends is ruined by unexpected weather. 
                As someone who has frequently experienced plans being disrupted by natural causes, I designed this website to be more than just a forecasting tool. 
                WeatherActive not only helps you plan with confidence but also serves as a source of inspiration, suggesting fun and engaging outdoor activities for those days 
                when you’re unsure what to do.
